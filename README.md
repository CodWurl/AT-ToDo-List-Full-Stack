# Software Dev Milestone Project 2

A MERN Stack To Do list that features complete crud functionality backed by a database and user friendly deign!

This was made over the course of 2 week in the NCSU Software Dev Bootcamp.  This was a group project in which both frontend and backend portions of the to do list was configured.  The project was divided between three individuals that were assigned different sections consisting of the frontend, backend and cloud database configuration in which data that was entered would be logged into the database upon submission.

## How it Works

The To Do List functions as a digital all around to do list that you could use for anything involving brief note taking and with the ability to store that data to be accessed within a cloud database where it can also be modified.  A given user can simply type their desired note of their choosing and add that note, reminder or message to a list of other notes that may have been previously added.  Additionally this app should also give individuals the option of editing or deleting list criteria as they see fit within it's modification.
